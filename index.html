    <p><strong><em>Mission:</em><strong>
      Our sole purpose is to provide our customers that fresh cup of warm coffee they need when they are
      in their happy place in the beautiful outdoors. Nothing is better than roasting a warm cup of freshly ground
      coffee beans while watching the sunrise on a brisk morning outside of your tent!</p>
      <h2>Locations:<h2>
        <p>
          <p>All locations are open 7 days a week, <em>6am to 9pm.</em>
            You can get a fresh cup of coffee to go, or buy ground beans to go.</p>
